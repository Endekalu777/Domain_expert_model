# Building a Domain Expert Model

## Introduction
This repository contains the final project for the Udacity and AWS course "Introducing Generative AI with AWS". The project demonstrates the creation of a Domain Expert model using generative AI techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can serve as a domain expert in a specific field. By leveraging generative AI, the model is capable of understanding and generating human-like responses, providing insights, and assisting users with domain-specific queries.

## Technologies Used
- Amazon SageMaker
- Llam 7b
- Python
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the model architecture)

## Model Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Ability to comprehend complex queries in natural language.
- **Content Generation**: Generate informative content based on the input provided.
- **Domain Specialization**: Trained on a specialized dataset to become an expert in a particular domain.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the project environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the Python packages.

## Usage
To use the Domain Expert model, follow the instructions below:
1. Start the model server (instructions provided in the `server` directory).
2. Send a POST request to the server with your query.
3. Receive the generated response from the model.
